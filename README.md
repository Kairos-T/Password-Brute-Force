# Password-Brute-Force

This code uses itertools to generate all possible combinations of lowercase and uppercase letters and digits up to 10 characters in length to try to crack a user-input password. The code also has a time limit of 60 seconds and displays a progress bar indicating the number of characters tried so far. If the password is found, the code will print it, otherwise it will print "Password not found."

UX tool (progress bar) still a WIP
